          SSL bug so it's reasonably safe to drop it from pidgin-sipe package.
  * Update package description to mention Skype for Business.

pidgin-sipe (1.11.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version
        - Feature #2945346: Lotus Notes/Domino Calendar integration:
          * Sipe can now retrieve calendar data (Meeting schedule/subject/
            location) from a web-enabled Lotus Domino server and publish it to
            OCS2007/LCS2005 as availability information.
          * Example: "Calendar: Currently Busy. Free at 11:30".
          * Team members (contacts with access level Team) will be able to see
            information about our current meeting (subject & location) (OCS2007)
          * First calendar update is scheduled 1 minute after connect,
          * Subsequent calendar updates happen in 30 minute intervals.
          * Manual calendar update can be triggered using the following menu:
                   Accounts->{SIPE_ACCOUNT}->"Republish Calendar"
          * Though Domino integration can work without any additional settings
            in account configuration (on Windows), there are options to manually
            provide Domino Services URL and email address/password if it's
            different from SIP URI/Password settings on Basic tab.
